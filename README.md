## Google Charts
For Assignment 7, we had to include at least two charts to our redesign project. We were given two .txt files where one contained 
information regarding the Total Energy Consumed in Floridafrom 1960 to 2016 [Click here to see](https://www.eia.gov/opendata/qb.php?sdid=SEDS.ESTCB.FL.A)
and Renewable Enery Produced in Florida from 1960 to 2015 [Click here to see](https://www.eia.gov/opendata/qb.php?sdid=SEDS.REPRB.FL.A)

My first chart was a column chart [Documentation](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/columnchart). I decided
to use a column chart because I wanted to showcase the two sets of data side-by-side so users of the website can see how each
set of data is affecting or not affecting the other. 

My second and third chart was a line chart [Documentation](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/linechart). I decided
on a linechart to showcase each set of data individually because I felt that it was the clearest way to display all that information
on one chart.
