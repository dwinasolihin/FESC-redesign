        <h1>FESC Bringing Energy Solutions to Florida, the Nation, and the World</h1>
        <section class="home-body">
            <p class="home-paragraph">
                The Florida Energy Systems Consortium (FESC) was created by the Florida State government to promote collaboration
                in energy-related expertise among the energy experts at its 12supported universities. The consortium assists the
                state in the development and implementation of an environmentallycompatible, sustainable, and efficient energy
                strategic plan.
            </p>

            <p class="home-paragraph">
                The Consortium was charged to ‘perform research and development on innovative energysystems that lead to alternative
                energy strategies, improved energy efficiencies, and expanded economic development for the state. The legislature
                appropriated funding for research at five of the universities as well as support for education, outreach, and technology
                commercialization.
            </p>

            <p class="home-paragraph">
                Overarching to the Consortium’s research strategy is an energy systems approach to identify innovation opportunities,
                prepare an energy workforce, and guide economic development.
            </p>

            <p class="home-paragraph">
                The Consortium reports to and provides guidance on an as needed basis to the:
                <ol>
                    <li>Florida Legislature</li>
                    <li>Executive Office of the Governor</li>
                    <li>Florida’s Office of Energy housed in the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <p class="home-paragraph">
                Through collaborative research and development across the State University System and the industry, the goal of the
                consortium is to become a world leader in energy research, education, technology, and energy systems analysis.
            </p>
            <p class="home-paragraph">
                In so doing, the consortium shall:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Coordinate and initiate increased collaborative interdisciplinary energy research among the universities
                            and the energy industry.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Assist in the creation and development of a Florida-based energy technology industry through efforts that
                            would expedite commercialization of innovative energy technologies by taking advantage of the energy
                            expertise within the State University System, high-technology incubators, industrial parks, and industry-driven
                            research centers.
                        </li>
                        <li>Provide a state resource for objective energy systems analysis.</li>
                        <li>Develop education and outreach programs to prepare a qualified energy workforce and informed public.</li>
                    </ul>
